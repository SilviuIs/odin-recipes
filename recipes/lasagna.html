  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that is made by layering wide flat noodles with a tomato-based sauce, cheese, and often meat or vegetables. The dish is typically baked in the oven until the noodles are tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Lasagna is a hearty and comforting meal that is perfect for feeding a crowd or enjoying as leftovers.</p>
  <p>The origins of lasagna can be traced back to ancient Greece, but the dish as we know it today is considered a quintessential Italian creation. The layers of noodles, sauce, and cheese can be endlessly customized to suit individual tastes, and lasagna has become a staple of Italian-American cuisine as well. Whether served as a traditional main course or as an inventive appetizer or side dish, lasagna remains a beloved and iconic dish around the world.</p>
