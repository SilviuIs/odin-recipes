  <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt-free garlic and herb seasoning blend</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 (3 pound) turkey breast with skin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced shallot</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>1 splash dry white wine</li>
    <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons half-and-half </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Mix together 1/4 cup butter, garlic, paprika, Italian seasoning, garlic and herb seasoning, salt, and black pepper in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Place turkey breast with skin side up into a roasting pan. Loosen skin with your fingers; brush half the butter mixture over the turkey breast and underneath the skin. Reserve remaining butter mixture. Tent turkey breast loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 1 hour; baste turkey breast with remaining butter mixture. Return to oven and roast until the juices run clear and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast, not touching bone, reads 165 degrees F (65 degrees C), about 30 more minutes. Let turkey breast rest 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    <li>While turkey is resting, transfer pan drippings to a skillet. Skim off excess grease, leaving about 1 tablespoon in skillet. Place skillet over low heat; cook and stir shallot in turkey grease until opaque, about 5 minutes</li>
    <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in skillet with shallot and whisk in white wine, scraping any browned bits of food from skillet. Whisk in chicken stock and flour until smooth. Bring to a simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened. For a creamier, lighter gravy, whisk in half-and-half.</li>
  </ol>
